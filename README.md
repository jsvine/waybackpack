# waybackpack

[![Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/v/waybackpack.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/waybackpack) [![Support Python versions](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/waybackpack.svg)](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/waybackpack)

Waybackpack is a command-line tool that lets you download the entire Wayback Machine archive for a given URL.

For instance, to download every copy of the Department of Labor's homepage through 1996 (which happens to be the first year the site was archived), you'd run:

```sh
waybackpack http://www.dol.gov/ -d ~/Downloads/dol-wayback --to-date 1996
```

Result:

```sh
~/Downloads/dol-wayback/
├── 19961102145216
│   └── www.dol.gov
│       └── index.html
├── 19961103063843
│   └── www.dol.gov
│       └── index.html
├── 19961222171647
│   └── www.dol.gov
│       └── index.html
└── 19961223193614
    └── www.dol.gov
        └── index.html
```

Or, just to print the URLs of all archived snapshots:

```sh
waybackpack http://www.dol.gov/ --list
```

## Installation

```
pip install waybackpack
```

  -d DIR, --dir DIR     Directory to save the files. Will create this
                        directory if it doesn't already exist.
  --list                Instead of downloading the files, only print the list
                        of snapshots.
  --raw                 Fetch file in its original state, without any

  --root ROOT           The root URL from which to serve snapshotted
                        resources. Default: 'https://web.archive.org'

  --collapse COLLAPSE   An archive.org `collapse` parameter. E.g., --collapse
                        timestamp:6 collapses results to at most one per

  --ignore-errors       Don't crash on non-HTTP errors e.g., the requests
                        library's ChunkedEncodingError. Instead, log error and

  --no-clobber          If a file is already present (and >0 filesize), don't
                        download it again.
  --quiet               Don't log progress to stderr.
  --progress            Print a progress bar. Mutes the default logging.

## Support

Waypackback is written in pure Python, depends only on [`requests`](docs.python-requests.org), and should work wherever Python works. Requires Python 3.3+.
